# Robot Formation and Path Tracking
MATLAB simulation where N robots must locate each other, form a line, and move as one. Our research publication is visible at /dox/final_paper.pdf

**Introduction:**
For a formal definition of the problem intended to be solved, please see /dox/ENEE 322 Project Fall 2016 v1.pdf

For our research publication, please see /dox/final_paper.pdf

For a solved demonstration of the five scenarios described in the publication, see /dox/simulations.pdf

**Running the Simulation:**

In order to keep our code readable and modular, we moved many of the calculations into helper functions that will be called in our "main.m" file. In order to run the simulation, simply open the "Code" folder in MATLAB and enter "main". This will run and plot all 5 simulations, as described in the project guidelines.

The main file contains initial conditions and destination points for different circumstances. To test different functionality, simply modify those state conditions vectors.

**Adding Changes:**

This simulation is not complete by any means. We would love to see additional contributions from the academic and professional community. There are a few suggested additions in the final paper if you need a place to get started. There are also a list of To-Dos below.

We hope to add additional documentation and comments to the code in the future for easier future developments.

**To-Dos:** 

Add a nice graphical interface in MATLAB, python or another language that images of Dubin's cars as the markers instead of plotting the individual points.
